<p>This is the BBDB FAQ, $Revision$.</p>

		<dt>What is the BBDB?</dt>
		<dd>Updated: 21 July 2000<br>
			<br>
			The BBDB is an addressbook for Emacs[1] users. It integrates
			tightly with Emacs-based mail and news readers, and
			provides some support for Netscape Mail and News. It is
			intended to be as unobtrusive in use as possible.<br>
			<br>
			The full name of BBDB is &quot;The Insidious Big Brother
			Database&quot;.<br><br>
            <em>[1] In this FAQ, &quot;Emacs&quot; refers to both <a
            href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> and
            <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>.</em><br><br></dd>
			
		<dt>What is the most current version of the BBDB?</dt>
		<dd>Updated: 12 June 2001<br>
			<br>
			The current stable version is 2.32. The current
			development version is 2.33. The versioning from 2.0 to
			2.32 is a little awkward, for hysterical raisins.<br><br></dd>

		<dt>Where can I get the most current version of the BBDB?</dt>
		<dd>Updated: 21 July 2000<br>
			<br>
			BBDB is hosted, developed and maintained at <a
			href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/</a>.
			The current stable and development releases are posted
			here.<br><br></dd>
			
		<dt>About the FAQ<dt>
		<dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
			<br>
            This FAQ is currently being constructed from a
            backlog of saved email messages from the bbdb-info mailing
            list. It is part of the BBDB CVS tree and thus can be
			updated by anyone with write access to the
			tree. Suggestions for additional questions (and answers!)
			can be sent to <a
			href="mailto:bbdb-faq@waider.ie">bbdb-faq@waider.ie</a>.<br>
            <br>
            The FAQ answers assume you have some familiarity with
            Emacs. Where configuration variables are mentioned,
            there's usually a <tt>customize</tt> interface that allows
            you to do point-and-click option setting.<br><br></dd>

        <dt>How do I install BBDB?</dt>
        <dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
            <br>
            Read the file INSTALL in the distribution<br><br></dd>

<!-- integrate with VM, Gnus, MH-E, RMail -->

  <dt>Configuring the BBDB</dt>

      <dl>
		<dt>BBDB sometimes displays the user's full name along with
          some names, and not with others.</dt>
        <dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
          <br>
          Set <tt>bbdb-dwim-net-address-allow-redundancy</tt> to
          <tt>t</tt>. This tells BBDB it's okay to add full names to
          addresses of the form
          &lt;Firstname.Lastname@wherever&gt;<br><br></dd>

<!-- I guess this question came off the mailing list. It should be
reformatted & answered.

"One question I ask me since begin: How can I insert new fields (say
 for signatures or v-card's) and how the hooks to set/get those new
 fields? Now, is this a FAQ?"

Answer: bbdb-notice-hook, bbdb-auto-notes-hook

        <dt>XEmacs is giving me an error about BBDB being already
        loaded.</dt>
        <dd>Updated: 25 February 2001 (David S. Goldman)<br>
        <br>
        Add the following before you call (bbdb-initialize):
        <pre>
(unload-feature 'bbdb-autoloads t)
        </pre>
        This is fixed in the developer release, and should be
        available in the next stable release.<br><br></dd>

        <dt>I downloaded the developer release from CVS and I can't
          build it.</dt>
        <dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
          <br>
          The developer version from CVS does not include the
          <tt>configure</tt> script; this should be generated using 
          <tt>autoconf</tt>. The <tt>configure</tt> script is included
          in the nightly tarball, so you can get it there if you
          wish. Alternatively, it may be downloaded from the <a
          href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">BBDB Web Site</a>.<br>
          <br>
          The other problem you may have is that you're on a Win32
          system with no support for Makefiles or scripts in
          general. Your options are to install the Cygwin environment
          (XXX there is a known issue with building under Cygwin XXX)
          or to check the mailing list archives for a recent
          <tt>make.bat</tt> file. The latter will probably migrate to
          the BBDB bits section of CVS once the author has nailed it
          down to his satisfaction.<br><br></dd>

            The BBDB was originally created by <a
            href="http://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a>. The 
			cast of characters involved since then is listed in the
			BBDB documentation. The current maintainer is <a
			href="http://www.waider.ie/">Waider</a>, assisted by
			whoever's got write access on the <a
			href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bbdb/">SourceForge
			tree</a> and a supporting cast on the bbdb-info mailing
			list.<br><br></dd>
