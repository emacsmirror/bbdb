    <h2>What is The Insidious Big Brother Database?</h2>
	
    <p>The Insidious Big Brother Database (BBDB) is a contact
	   management utility created by <a
	   href="http://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a> for use with
	   Emacs.  It is tightly integrated with several mail and news
	   readers (see below), allowing it to create database entries
	   directly from mail and news messages.  As is usual with
	   applications for Emacs, this record creation can be configured
	   in many ways, ranging from a boolean create/don't create
	   setting to creation based on the result of a user-supplied
	   function.</p>

    <p>Database records can be used to store many types of
	   information, from name and address to URLs and X-Face images.
	   This information can be displayed when a message from an entity
	   named in a database record is recieved.  In addition, messages
	   from database members can be tagged in the Gnus Summary Buffer,
	   and Gnus scoring can be configured based on the contents of
	   database records.  Supercite citations can even be preset
	   through the use of records in the BBDB.</p>

    <h2>Requirements:</h2>

    <h3>Supported versions of Emacs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Gnu</a> <a
      href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/emacs/">Emacs</a> versions 19.34 and
      above</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a> versions 19.16 and
      above</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Supported Mail and News readers</h3>

    <p>The BBDB can be used without a mail- or news-reader.  It has,
    however, been optimized for use with one.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.gnus.org/">Gnus</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/">VM</a></li>
      <li>MH-e</li>
      <li>Rmail</li>
      <li>UNIX <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> Mail
		  (via bbdb-srv)</li>
      <li>UNIX <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> News

    </ul>
    
    <a name="get"></a><h2>Getting the BBDB</h2>

    <p>BBDB 2.00.06 is the current released version. It fixes a number
    of things that emacs 20.x breaks in BBDB 2.00, such as key
    mappings. You can get it <a href="bbdb-2.00.06.tar.gz">here</a>; the
    <a href="bbdb-2.00.06.tar.gz.sig">PGP signature</a> is also
    available. (the key is <a
    href="../../../misc/waider@waider.ie.asc">here</a>).</p>

    <h3>Current development version: Provisionally 2.2</h3>

    <p>This is as-yet untagged; the change in not-quite-major number reflects
       the following caveat:
	
    <p><b>WARNING</b>: this modifies the BBDB file format. Anything
	which relies on BBDB's current file format will no longer
	work. Alex has also written a function to revert the file format
	to the 2.00.06 variant - see the <a
	href="index.html#links">links</a> section below. I've modified it
	to handle the further hack I've inflicted on the streets field.</p>

    <p>This is now in CVS at the head of the tree; you can grab a
    tarball <a href="bbdb-2.2.tar.gz">here</a>. Note, the tarball
    might have one or two things that aren't yet in CVS, most notably
    updates to documentation. The code is solid, though, since it's my
    live copy of BBDB.</p>

    <h3>Compilation notes:</h3>
    <ol>

      <li>Compilation is known to work with Solaris make and with GNU
	      make.  If you discover compilation problems with other
	      versions of make, please submit a bug report to <a
	      href="mailto:bbdb-info@lists.sourceforge.net">bbdb-info@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
	      The make binary shipped with IRIX 6.2 is known not to work
	      with BBDB version 2.00. Also, some of the test targets don't
	      work with GNU make, since MAKEFLAGS doesn't include "-".

      <li>Texinfo 3.11 (or later) is required to compile the texinfo
          documentation.  It is available at <a
          href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu">the GNU FTP site</a>.
		  Precompiled info files are included in the tarball.
    </ol>
    
    <h2>CVS tree</h2>

    <p>The development and release versions are available via Anon-CVS
       to the CVS tree at <tt>cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net</tt>.  To access the
       tree, log in with the following command:

    <pre>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb login
    </pre>

    The password is blank; just hit return at the prompt.</p>

    To check out a version of the BBDB, use one of the following commands:

    <pre>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb checkout bbdb
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb checkout -r rev bbdb
    </pre>

    The first command will check out a copy of the latest version.
    Usually this latest version will be a development version, but it
    may fetch a release version if the command is executed soon enough
    after a release version is made available.<p></p>

    The second command allows control of the version retrieved,
    through the <tt>-r rev</tt> argument.  The <tt>rev</tt> portion of
    the argument should be replaced with a word of the form:<p></p>

    <center><tt>BBDB_</tt><i>x</i><tt>_</tt><i>yy</i></center><p></p>

    <i>x</i> and <i>yy</i> are components of the version to be retrieved, as in
    <i>x</i>.<i>yy</i>.  <b>Note:</b> <tt>unoff</tt> should be appended to the
    above word for all versions prior to 2.00.<p></p>

    To retrieve version 1.90, use the following argument:<br>

    <pre>
    -r BBDB_1_90unoff
    </pre>

    To retrieve version 2.00.06, use the following argument:<br>

    <pre>
    -r BBDB_2_00_06
    </pre>
 
    <a name="manual"></a><h2>Manual</h2>

    <a href="bbdb.html">This</a> is a HTML version of the texinfo
    manual that accompanies BBDB. It's rough, but it'll do for the mo
    until I organise myself some more.

    <a name="get"></a><h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

    There are two mailing lists for the BBDB:<p></p>

    <ul>
      <li><tt>bbdb-info</tt><br>
	      General discussion about the BBDB, both for users and
          developers.  Some of it is archived at <tt><a
          href="ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/bbdb/">ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/bbdb/</a></tt>,
          but this is very old (June 1996).  A more current archive
          can be found at <a
          href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40xemacs.org/">http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40xemacs.org/</a>. SourceForge has built-in archiving which doesn't seem to be working just yet, which means some of the messages have been, well, not archived. Working on this.</li>

     <li><tt>bbdb-announce</tt><br>
         Announcements of new BBDB versions.  This list is moderated,
         and has very low volume.</li>

    </ul>

    To subscribe to either mailing list, send mail to
    <i>listname</i><tt>-request@lists.sourceforge.org</tt> with
    <tt>subscribe</tt> as the body. You will receive a reply
    requesting confirmation of your subscription; return the
    confirmation as described in the email, and you're on the
    list. Alternatively you can visit the list signup page, linked
    from the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4236">sourceforge
    project page</a>.
