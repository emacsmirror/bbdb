<h2>What is The Insidious Big Brother Database?</h2>

<p>The Insidious Big Brother Database (BBDB) is a contact management
utility created by <a href="http://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a> for
use with <a href="http://www.emacs.org">Emacs</a>.  It is tightly
integrated with several mail and news readers (see below), allowing it
to create database entries directly from mail and news messages.  As is
usual with applications for Emacs, this record creation can be
configured in many ways, ranging from a boolean create/don't create
setting to creation based on the result of a user-supplied function.</p>

<p>Database records can be used to store many types of
information, from name and address to URLs and X-Face images.
This information can be displayed when a message from an entity
named in a database record is recieved.  In addition, messages
from database members can be tagged in the Gnus Summary Buffer,
and Gnus scoring can be configured based on the contents of
database records.  Supercite citations can even be preset
through the use of records in the BBDB.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

<h3>Supported versions of Emacs</h3>

<dl>
 <dt><strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Gnu</a>
   <a href="http://www.emacs.org/">Emacs</a></strong>
  <dd>versions 19.34 and above</dd>
 <dt><strong><a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a></strong>
  <dd>versions 19.16 and above</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Supported Mail and News readers</h3>

<p>The BBDB can be used without a mail- or news-reader.  It has,
however, been optimized for use with one.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.gnus.org/">Gnus</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/">VM</a></li>
  <li>MH-e</li>
  <li>Rmail</li>
  <li>UNIX <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> Mail
   (via bbdb-srv)</li>
  <li>UNIX <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> News
   (via bbdb-srv)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="get">Getting the BBDB</a></h2>

<p><a href="bbdb-2.00.06.tar.gz">BBDB 2.00.06</a> is the current
released version.  It fixes a number of things that emacs 20.x breaks in
BBDB 2.00, such as key mappings.</p>

<h3>Current development version: 2.2</h3>

<p>This is as-yet untagged; the change in minor revision number
reflects the following caveat:

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: this modifies the BBDB file format.
Anything which relies on BBDB's current file format will no longer work.
Alex has also written a function to revert the file format to the
2.00.06 variant - see the <a href="#links">links</a> section below.
I've modified it to handle the further hack I've inflicted on the
streets field.</p>

<p>This is now in CVS at the head of the tree; you can grab the
<a href="bbdb-2.2.tar.gz">tarball</a>. This is updated from CVS at
midnight Pacific Time on the <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> site.</p>

<h3>Compilation notes:</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Compilation is known to work with Solaris make and with GNU
  make.  If you discover compilation problems with other
  versions of make, please submit a bug report to <a
  href="mailto:bbdb-info@lists.sourceforge.net">bbdb-info@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
  The make binary shipped with IRIX 6.2 is known not to work
  with BBDB version 2.00. Also, some of the test targets don't
  work with GNU make, since MAKEFLAGS doesn't include "-".<br>
  <br>
  Didier Verna is currently working on <tt>autoconf</tt> support, so
  that the above problem should go away.</li>

 <li>Texinfo 3.11 (or later) is required to compile the texinfo
  documentation.  It is available at <a
  href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu">the GNU FTP site</a>.
  Precompiled info files are included in the tarball.
</ol>

<h2>CVS tree</h2>

<p>The development and release versions are available via Anon-CVS
to the CVS tree at <code>cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net</code>.  To access the
tree, log in with the following command:

<pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb login
</pre>

The password is blank; just hit return at the prompt.</p>

To check out a version of the BBDB, use one of the following commands:

<pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb checkout bbdb
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bbdb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb checkout -r rev bbdb
</pre>

<p>The first command will check out a copy of the latest version.
Usually this latest version will be a development version, but it may
fetch a release version if the command is executed soon enough after a
release version is made available.</p>

<p>The second command allows control of the version retrieved, through
the <code>-r rev</code> argument.  The <code>rev</code> portion of the
argument should be replaced with a word of the form:</p>

<center><code>BBDB_</code><var>x</var><code>_</code><var>yy</var></center>

<p><var>x</var> and <var>yy</var> are components of the version to be
retrieved, as in <var>x</var>.<var>yy</var>.
<strong>Note:</strong> <code>unoff</code> should be appended to the
above word for all versions prior to 2.00.</p>

To retrieve version 1.90, use the following argument:<br>

<pre>
-r BBDB_1_90unoff
</pre>

To retrieve version 2.00.06, use the following argument:<br>

<pre>
-r BBDB_2_00_06
</pre>

<h2><a name="manual">Manual</a></h2>

<p><a href="bbdb.html">This</a> is a HTML version of the texinfo manual
that accompanies BBDB generated by <a
href="http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~obachman/Texi2html"
><code>texi2html</code></a>.</p>

<h2><a name="get">Mailing Lists</a></h2>

<p>There are two mailing lists for the BBDB:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><strong>bbdb-info</strong></dt>
  <dd>General discussion about the BBDB, both for users and developers.
   Some of it was archived at <a
 href="http://www.xemacs.org/">Xemacs.org</a>, but was very old (June
 1996) and 
   I've asked them to remove it - it'll reappear here soon for posterity.
   The archive for mails up to end of April 2000 can be found at
   <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40xemacs.org/"
   >http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40xemacs.org/</a>.
   Since April 2000 mails are archived at
   <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40lists.sourceforge.net/"
   >http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40lists.sourceforge.net/</a>.

  <p>SourceForge has built-in archiving which didn't initially
  seem to be working, but is apparently okay now.</p>

 <dt><strong>bbdb-announce</strong></dt>
  <dd>Announcements of new BBDB versions.  This list is moderated, and
   has very low volume.</dd>
</dl>

To subscribe to either mailing list, send mail to
<var>listname</var><code>-request@lists.sourceforge.net</code> with
<code>subscribe</code> as the body. You will receive a reply
requesting confirmation of your subscription; return the
confirmation as described in the email, and you're on the
list. Alternatively you can visit the list signup page, linked
from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbdb">sourceforge
project page</a>.

<h2><a name="links">Links</a></h2>

<p>Several people have been hacking at BBDB and have pages describing
what they're at. Please check which version of BBDB they apply to
before attempting to use them!</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/kensanata/">Alex Schroeder</a>
  has done some work on <a
  href="http://www.geocities.com/kensanata/bbdb-funcs.html">address
  formats and pine/mailrc integration</a>. He's also responsible for
  making BBDB handle non-US addresses a lot better.</li>

 <li><a href="http://www.Jochen-Kuepper.de/">Jochen
  K&uuml;pper</a> has done some work on
  <code>bbdb-print</code>, which is now in CVS.</li>

 <li><a href="mailto:Thomas.DeWeese@Kodak.com?subject=BBDB">Thomas
  DeWeese</a> has a <a
  href="http://www.moshpit.org/pilotmgr/">PilotManager</a> plugin
  called <a
  href="http://home.rochester.rr.com/tsdeweese/SyncBBDB.html">SyncBBDB</a>.</li>

 <li><a href="http://www.splode.com/~friedman/">Noah Friedman</a> is
 currently maintaining <a href="http://www.jwz.org/">jwz</a>'s <a

 <li><a href="http://linuxcare.com.au/people/martins/">Martin
 Schwenke</a> has written some code to export BBDB records to a Nokia
 phone via <a href="http://www.gnokii.org/">gnokii</a>. You can find
 it at <a href="http://linuxcare.com.au/people/martins/hacks/emacs/">his web
 site</a>.</li>

 <li><a href="http://www.valente.de/aldo/palm/">Aldo Valente</a> has
 done some work on making SyncAB (from <a
 href="http://www.moshpit.org/pilotmgr/">PilotManager</a>)
 work with BBDB.</li>

 <li><href="http://t2100cdt.kippona.net/linux/emacs/mew/">Chris
  Beggy</a> has managed to get BBDB working with Mew, a mailreader
  with Japanese language support. There's a bbdb-mew.el on this page
  which should probably make it into the official tree at some
  point.</li>

 <li>The <code>bits</code> subdirectory in the source tree contains
  random bits and pieces that I've collected but not
  integrated, including a generic export filter of sorts and PGP and
  Outlook integration/interaction.</li>
